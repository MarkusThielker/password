# ðŸ”‘ Password Trainer

Before changing important passwords and then struggling to enter them correctly, start building muscle memory first.
This application provides you the possibility to store new passwords securely and learn them over time.
Gamification like success rates, typing time tracking and daily prompts to enter a password help you learn them faster.

## Security
An app handling secrets like these has to be implemented securely. That's why:

- Passwords are securely stored in your devices keychain
- Authentication is required to enter the app
- No cloud sync (unless you are using your iCloud Keychain)
